#The aim of this project is to use TensorFlow to fusing our muliti-data.

#input_data.py:  read in data and generate batches

#model: build the model architecture

#training: train

#I used Ubuntu with Python 2.7, TensorFlow 1.0*, other OS should also be good.

#With current settings, 2000 traing steps .


#data: from public remote image

#How to run?

#1. run the classifyUrl.py once

#2. call the classificater().

# Note:
#you should change the logs_train_dir to your own dir in classifyUrl.py

#change the multi-data-dir on your own dir

#in input_data have different coding depended on your intension read careful
